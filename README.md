While it is probably outside the scope of what can be done with the original document I decided to go with a uted color scale of greys, whites, and browns. I did not like the idea of color influencing information. That might be useful if someone is asking for money or trying to get ideas across, but here we are just trying to inform. I tried both a waffle chart and a pie chart. Looking at it now after the fact I should have added the exact total number of students on the inside of the donut chart. That is actually more important than the breakdown for most people reading this document.
